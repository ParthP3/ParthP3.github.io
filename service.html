              </h4>
              <p>
                Theoretical computer science (TCS) is a subset of general computer science and mathematics that focuses on mathematical aspects of computer science.
                It is difficult to circumscribe the theoretical areas precisely. One could say TCS covers a wide variety of
                 topics including algorithms, data structures, computational complexity, parallel and distributed computation,
                 probabilistic computation, quantum computation, automata theory, information theory, cryptography, 
                 program semantics and verification, algorithmic game theory, machine learning, computational biology, 
                 computational economics, computational geometry, and computational number theory and algebra. 
                 Work in this field is often distinguished by its emphasis on mathematical technique and rigor.

                Music means everything to me. From Indian and Western Classical to Pop, from Hip-hop to Jazz, nothing gets me more fired up or more enthralled 
                than some good music. My favourite artists from various genres are Bruno Mars, the Weeknd, Pt. Mukundraj Godbole, Pt. Chhota Gandharva, 
                Pt. Vasantrao and Rahul Deshpande (Indian classical), 
                Grigory Sokolov, Pollini, Hillary Hahn and Martha Argerich (western classical) and Arjit Singh. Do listen to some of my music recommendations :)

                AI and Data Science
              </h4>
              <p>
                Something that fascinates almost everyone is Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Data Science. These are broad terms often used together.
                 Data science involves using mathematical and statistical techniques to extract insights and knowledge from data. 
                It involves collecting, cleaning, and analyzing data in order to identify patterns and trends that can be used to make informed decisions. 
                With the explosion of data in recent years, data science has become an increasingly important field in a wide range of industries, from healthcare to finance to marketing.
                AI, on the other hand, involves creating intelligent systems that can perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence. This includes tasks such as natural language processing, image recognition, and decision-making. 
                AI systems rely heavily on data, as they need to be trained on large datasets in order to learn and improve their performance. Do check out my github for some cool projects on 
                Data Science, Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning, etc. I am also part of a team working on autonomous vehicles! Check UMIC out for some cool
                 info on self driving cars.

                Sketching
              </h4>
              <p>
                As someone who has always had a passion for the arts, sketching and digital art have become two of my favorite hobbies. 
                There's something incredibly satisfying about being able to express myself through visual art, whether it's on paper or on a computer screen.
                Sketching has been a hobby of mine for as long as I can remember. It's a great way to unwind and focus my thoughts after a long day. 
                I love the simplicity of pencil and paper, and the way that even the most basic sketch can capture so much emotion and energy. 
                But digital art offers a whole new world of possibilities. With the use of software like Adobe Photoshop or Procreate, I'm able to create artwork that's not limited by the physical properties of traditional art materials. 
                I can experiment with colors, textures, and styles in a way that's simply not possible with a pencil and paper. 
                And while it can be more complex and technically challenging, it's also incredibly rewarding to see a digital artwork come to life on my computer screen. 
                I greatly owe my interest in art to my sister. If you're here, thankyou for showing me this wonderful world and please don't judge my art too much.
